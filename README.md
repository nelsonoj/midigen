Clone the repo and then run make. It will create an executable called midigen. The programme can then be executed with ./midigen, or with make test. It's up to you :)

Hello! I am Nelson Odins-Jones, also known as z5122504, and this is what I did for the free choice component of COMP1917.
The code is all very simple objectively speaking, but for me, it was a huge amount of work and I am rather proud.
I hope you enjoy it.
